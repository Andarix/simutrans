<title>Prologue</title>

<h1><strong>Welcome to Simutrans...</strong></h1>

<p>
Choose one, out of the many thousands, of Simutrans' maps or create a new one from a height map. Then, put yourself in the shoes of a young entrepreneur with some money from your grandparents: eager to make them proud, with ambitions of establishing a successful transport company, your challenge now is to build a prospering enterprise.
</p>
<p>
As time passes, develop your company into transport empire, keeping the economy running smoothly by delivering freight & satisfying the travel requirements of millions of passengers every month.<br>
Transport passengers, mail & goods by rail, road, ship & even air.
</p>
<p>
Every map has something different to offer. Take a good look at your surroundings...its future lies in the hands of you and your competitors.
</p>
<p>
In the beginning, it may be easier to start by simply supplying a power station with the goods it needs. Then, connect other factories, maybe even using central hubs where goods are reloaded.<br>
The disadvantage of only transporting goods is that towns and cities won't grow and new industries will not appear.
</p>
<p>
Alternatively, you may immediately go for passenger (and mail) transport. This is more challenging, as the inhabitants of this world want to travel to specific places. <br>
Some need to go to factories to work, some want to go shopping at the large mall in the main town, and others want to go sightseeing.
</p>
<p>
If you don't offer a connection to their destination, they will not travel with you at all. You will need to build a transport network where as many as possible destinations can be reached - at least all the popular ones. When your networks are established, you will need to upgrade them to keep abreast of demand. So plan ahead.<br>
If passengers like your service, towns will grow and new industries will be established and only then will the economy run smoothly.
</p>
<p>
You can play as long as you like. Start in 1880 and finish in 2050. There will be new vehicles and buildings throughout this time.<br>
Play against the AI or on your own. Only if your net wealth is negative for three months in a row, you will go bankrupt and the game is over. Check your net wealth in the Finances window.
