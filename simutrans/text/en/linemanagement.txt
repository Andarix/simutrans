<title>Line Management</title>

<h1><strong>Line Management</strong></h1>

<p>
<strong>Line Management</strong> provides information and controls to manage Lines (routes and minimum quantity of goods & passengers required by a <a href="convoiinfo.txt">Convoy</a> to proceed) for a Convoy or multiple Convoys with the same route.
</p>
<p>
Lines consist of <a href="station.txt">Stops</a> where vehicles pick-up and drop-off goods & passengers (water-transport vehicles may use any square of water in the catchment area of a dock) and waypoints (used to direct vehicles if more than one option is possible or provide interim destination points).
</p>

</p>
<p>
The left hand side of <strong>Line Management</strong> lists existing Lines (to scroll list: use slider-bar on right of list), which can be filtered by transport type, click on a index-tab above list to select:<br>
<em>All</em>: lists Lines for all vehicles.<br>
