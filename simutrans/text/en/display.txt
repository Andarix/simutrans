</p>
<p>
<em>Scroll Inverse:</em> reverses the direction of scroll for game-view in <a href="window.txt">Game Window</a>.
</p>

<em>

<p>
<em>Pedestrians in towns:</em> pedestrians will appear in <a href="citywindow.txt">urban areas</a>.
</p>
<p>
<em>Pedestrians at stops:</em> pedestrians will appear when a vehicle arrives at a <a href="station.txt">Stop</a>.
</p>
<p>
<em>Traffic density:</em> sets the number of private cars in <a href="citywindow.txt">urban areas</a>.<br>
The number of new private cars that appear as urban areas grow is dependent on size of urban area and traffic density. Higher values create more private traffic, while '0' generates none.

<strong>Display Information:</strong>
</p>
<p>
Below these settings, information is shown on computer performance when running Simutrans.<br>
Numbers are white when everything is working well; if they are red or yellow then you may need to change your settings.<br>

If you change the that time passes in the game, using Fast Forward  >> icon at top of game-view, or [,]/ [.]), this may also change number colour.
</p>
<p>
<em>Frame Time:</em> First number is intended time between frames; second number is actual time between frames.
</p>
<p>
<em>Idle:</em> When above 0, the computer has capacity to run other software.
</p>
<p>
<em>
FPS:</em> Higher values mean vehicles appear to move more smoothly. If number remains red, the computer is too slow for current settings (try reducing the size of the game-view window).
</p>
<p>
<em>Simloops:</em> If number remains red, the computer is too slow for current settings - try a smaller map with fewer urban areas.
