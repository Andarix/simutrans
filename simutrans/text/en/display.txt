<strong>Display Information:</strong>
</p>
<p>
Below these settings, information is shown on computer performance when running Simutrans.<br>
If numbers (usually white) are red or ?yellow you may need to change your settings.<br>
Changes in rate that time passes in game, <a href="window.txt">T</a>, (using Fast Forward  >> icon at top of game-view, or [,]/ [.]) may change number colour.
</p>
<p>
<em>Frame Time:</em> ?First number is intended time between frames; second number is actual time between frames.
</p>
<p>
<em>Idle:</em> When above 0, the computer has capacity to run other software.
</p>
<p>
<em>
FPS:</em> Higher values mean vehicles appear to move more smoothly. If number remains red, the computer is too slow for current settings (?try reducing the size of the game-view window).
</p>
<p>
<em>Simloops:</em> If number remains red, the computer is too slow for current settings - try a smaller map with fewer urban areas.
