<it>Map Options</it>
</p>

<p>
<em>Water Level</em> - Sets how high the water is on the map. Higher values provide lesser land and more water bodies.
</p>

<p>
<em>Mountain Height</em> - Sets the maximum height of terrain.
</p>

<p>
<em>Map Roughness</em> - Sets the roughness of the terrain. A larger number creates more undulations in the coastal areas. To create realistic coast lines, use a higher value.<br>
</p>

<p>
<it>Snowline Options</it>
<br>Snowline is the height on the map at which snow appears.
</p>
<p>

<em>summer snowline</em> - The snowline during summer. This value is the highest terrain value selected in the climate options.
</p>

<p>
<em>Winter Snowline</em> - Sets height of snowline in winter. To have snow appear in larger areas on the map, keep this value low.
</p>

<p>
<it>Climate Options</it>
<br>Sets the different climate options for the new map. <br>The value next to each climate type sets the height in the terrain map where the climate appears. To turn off a particular climate, set its value to 0 (zero).
</p>

<p>
<em>Desert Climate</em>  - Very little precipitation, extremes in temperature. Very few trees. Flat landscape.
</p>
<p>

<em>Tropical Climate</em> - Typical of non-arid areas around equator, constant high temperature at sea level and low elevations.
</p>

<p>
<em>Mediterranean climate</em> - Moderate changeable wet weather
</p>

<p>
<em>Temperate Climate</em> - Found in areas between tropics and polar caps, changing weather.
</p>

<p>
<em>Tundra</em> - Low temperatures, edges of polar caps

</p>

<p>
<it>Other Options</it>
</p>

<p>
<em>No Tree</em> - Click to enable. Enable this option to prevent Simutrans from drawing trees. Trees take up CPU time to render. Use this option on PCs with slower CPU or low RAM.
</p>

<p>
<em>Number of Rivers</em> - Sets the maximum number of rivers that can be generated and used in a terrain map. Rivers cannot be navigated by boats or ships of any kind.
</p>

<p>
<em>Minimum length of river</em> - Sets the minimum length of rivers on the map in terms of number of squares.
</p>

<p>
<em>Maximum length of river</em> - Sets the maximum length of rivers on the map in terms of number of squares.
