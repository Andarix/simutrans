To be done:
- fixed_maintenance_cost for vehicles (low for trailers/wagons, high for engines,trucksbus,planes)
- menu_position (left, top, right, bottom?)
- ownership in minimap
- loading times for convois (entry loading_time per unit and car; easy change and open more freedom for pak set design)
- weight limit on ways by axle_load entry in vehicles (to avoid problem when going back and forth with diff. load)
- busy platform images
- Signals switching nearly like before (should be easy)
- more financial history
- detail on vehicles (like factory_details)
- city wayobj instead just sidewalks

partially done:
- connection weighted by their intermediate stops => A* for goods routing [A* did not worked out, but intermediate stops may be considered]
- tile 2x height: halfway-> need conversion for textures needed
- merge identical images in makeobj: done, merged them on loadtime
- scripting for AI: AIs are now seperate files and can be added: on the way

CHECK:
resize greater than 2400*1536 crashes simutrans
Toolwindow with 10 last used tools (in fixed order)
bahnhofsdetaildialog (on the station buildings)
