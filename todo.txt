To be done:
- fixed_maintenance_cost for vehicles (low for trailers/wagons, high for engines,trucksbus,planes): incorporated into besch
- menu_position (left, top, right, bottom?)
- loading times for convois (entry loading_time per unit and car; easy change and open more freedom for pak set design)
- weight limit on ways by axle_load entry in vehicles (to avoid problem when going back and forth with diff. load)
- busy platform images
- Signals switching nearly like before (should be easy)
- detail on vehicles (like factory_details)
- city wayobj instead just sidewalks
- building/tree heights in dats
- fog view to the top?
- instant text updates
- toolwindow with 10 last used tools (in fixed order)
- bahnhofsdetaildialog (more text on the station buildings)
- unified list dialoges (with their filer as component)
- depot list
- vehicle list

partially done:
- tile 2x height: halfway-> need conversion for textures needed
- climate per tiles
- connection weighted by their intermediate stops => A* for goods routing [A* did not worked out, but intermediate stops may be considered]
- merge identical images in makeobj: done, merged them on loadtime
- scripting: on the way

reconsider:
- leave stop if other convoi has arrived there patch
- viewports (even if they are perfomance killers ... )
- routing penalty sign (but a proper one)
- extended statistics patch

CHECK:
resize greater than 2400*1536 crashes simutrans
