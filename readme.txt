Compiling Simutrans
===================

This is a short guide on compiling simutrans. If you want more detailed information, read the Compiling Simutrans forum thread https://simutrans-germany.com/wiki/wiki/en_CompilingSimutrans

If you are on Windows, download either MSVC or MinGW. MSVC is easy for debugging, MSYS2 is easy to set up (but it has to be done on the command line).
- MSVC:  https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/
- MSYS2: https://www.msys2.org/ 

Getting the libraries
------------------------

You will need pkgconfig (Unix) or vcpkg (Microsoft Visual C++) https://github.com/Microsoft/vcpkg

- Needed (All): libpng2 libbzip2 zlib 
- Needed (Linux/Mac): libSDL2 libfluidsynth (for midi music)
- Optional but recommended: libzstd (faster compression) libfreetype (TrueType font support) miniupnpc (for easy server setup)

- MSVC: Copy install-building-libs-{architecture}.bat to the vcpkg folder and run it.
- MSYS2: Run setup-mingw.sh to get the libraries and set up the environment.
- Linux: Use https://pkgs.org/ to search for development libraries available in your package manager.
- Mac: Install libraries via Homebrew: https://brew.sh/

Compiling
---------

Go to the source code directory of simutrans (simutrans/trunk if you downloaded from svn). You have three build systems to choose from: make, MSVC, and CMake. We recommend make or MSVC for debug builds.

Compiling will give you only the executable, you still need a Simutrans installation to run the program. You can start simutrans with "-use_workdir" to point it to an existing installation.

1) make

(MacOS) autoreconf -ivf
(Linux) autoconf
./configure
make -j 4
(MacOS) make OSX/getversion

2) Microsoft Visual C++

Open the simutrans.sln, select the target (default is GDI) and build.

3) CMake

mkdir build && cd build
(Unix) cmake -G "Insert Correct Makefiles Generator" ..
(Unix) cmake build . -j 4
(MSVC) cmake.exe .. -G "Visual Studio 16 2019" -A x64 -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=[vcpkg-root]/scripts/buildsystems/vcpkg.cmake
(MSVC) cmake.exe --build . --config Release

See here a list of generators: https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/manual/cmake-generators.7.html
